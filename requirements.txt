# LLM and AI frameworks
langchain-community # For Ollama and other community integrations
langchain # Core Langchain (often pulled by langchain-community or useful for other LC features)
ollama # The Python client for Ollama

# Machine learning and NLP
scikit-learn # For CountVectorizer, cosine_similarity
sentence-transformers # For semantic search embeddings
torch # Essential for sentence-transformers and FAISS

# Vector search and similarity
faiss-cpu # For local CPU-based vector search (use faiss-gpu if targeting GPU)
numpy # Dependency for many ML/numerical libraries

# Database (SQLite is built-in, no external package needed for sqlite3)

# Utilities and data processing
python-dotenv # For .env file handling

# Security and authentication
passlib[bcrypt] # Pulls in bcrypt for password hashing

# Structured Logging
structlog

# --- Potentially Optional (verify if truly needed or pulled transitively) ---
# transformers # Often a dependency of sentence-transformers; keep if errors occur without it
# joblib # scikit-learn might use it internally; if not explicitly used, can be optional
# cryptography # passlib or other security libs might need it

# --- Development and testing dependencies (comment out for production builds) ---
# pytest
# black
# flake8
