**--- ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS ---**

Please provide your feedback in the following Markdown format. Be specific and provide examples where possible.

**I. ATS KEYWORD ALIGNMENT & MISSING SKILLS:**
   *   **Missing Keywords/Skills:** List critical keywords, skills, technologies, or qualifications mentioned in the JOB DESCRIPTION that are ABSENT or NOT EMPHASIZED in the RESUME.
       *   Example: "- Missing: 'Agile Project Management', 'Python (for data analysis)'"
   *   **Keyword Density/Relevance:** Briefly comment if key terms for the TARGET ROLE seem underrepresented.

**II. CONTENT RELEVANCE & IMPACT (Tailoring to Job Description):**
   *   **Irrelevant Content:** Identify specific bullet points or sections in the RESUME that seem LEAST relevant to the JOB DESCRIPTION and TARGET ROLE. Suggest removal or rephrasing.
       *   Example: "- Consider removing/rephrasing: 'Managed office supplies inventory' (if role is senior software engineer)."
   *   **Quantifiable Achievements:** For relevant experience, suggest where to add METRICS or specific examples to demonstrate impact (STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result).
       *   Example: "- For 'Led a team project': Quantify if possible, e.g., 'Led a team of 5 engineers to deliver Project X 2 weeks ahead of schedule, resulting in Y% cost saving.'"
   *   **Action Verbs:** Identify any weak action verbs and suggest stronger alternatives. (e.g., "Worked on" -> "Developed", "Managed", "Orchestrated").

**III. CLARITY, STRUCTURE & FORMATTING:**
   *   **Clarity & Conciseness:** Point out any jargon (unless highly relevant to the role), overly complex sentences, or areas that could be more direct.
   *   **Formatting Consistency:** Note any inconsistencies (e.g., date formats like MM/YYYY vs. Month YYYY, bullet point styles, font usage if apparent from text).
   *   **Resume Structure:** Briefly comment if the overall structure (e.g., order of sections) is logical for the TARGET ROLE.

**IV. OVERALL SUMMARY & KEY RECOMMENDATION:**
   *   Provide a brief (2-3 sentences) overall impression of the resume's fit for the job.
   *   State the SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT area the candidate should focus on for improvement for THIS specific job application.
